# Challenge Summary

Code Challenge 03

## Challenge Description

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency

Step one is to evaluate the problem and think critically. Then take out your white board and get to brain storming. Once you feel comfortable write out the code and check to see if it works.
