# Hashtables

Implement a Hashtable

## Challenge
Create a hashmap that is able to test the following it

Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure

Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored

Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable

Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable

Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision

Successfully hash a key to an in-range value


## Approach & Efficiency

Brian helped set this one up. After hours of googling the get and contain works

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
